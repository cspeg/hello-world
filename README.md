# hello-world

I created a GitHub account because I want to explore coding. So far, I've been doing some online introductory courses on coding (Python, JAVA, HTML and CSS), but I feel I need some real project to get more involved with coding. I plan to be doing some more tutorials and hope to find some projects that I can contribute to even as an absolute beginner.
